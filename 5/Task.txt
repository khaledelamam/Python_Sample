make a dictionary of at least 3 subjects each with a (name,final_grade=0).
make a dictionary of a student with (name,subject,grade).

make a package with 2 modules inside of it :
	Teacher module:
		* function that takes a subjects dictionary as an arg and fills in final grades from the teacher (input)

	student module:
		* function that takes in a student as an arg and checks if he passed his subject or not
		grade / final_grade -> if more than 0.5 = passed

NOTE :
	handle Zero division error if the passing grade is 0.
	handle value error/type error if the grade are strings instead of ints.
